                            The unique combination of PIN code and contactless RFID technology make it tremendously easy to organise your different security levels and user groups (e.g. VIPs, club members, day guests or staff).

                            Simply lightly touch the key fields to input your personal PIN code (capacitive technology). RFID data carriers are simply held in front of the reading field for identification.

                            Convenient time control to automatically open or lock cabinets prevents lockers from being reserved.

                            Cabinets and lockers can be accessed via RFID data carrier or completely keylessly via PIN code (e.g. in the sauna area).
